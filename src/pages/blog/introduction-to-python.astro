  <h2>What is Python?</h2>
  <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.</p>

  <h2>Why Python?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Easy to learn and read</li>
    <li>Extensive libraries and frameworks</li>
    <li>Versatile and used for web development, data science, automation, and more</li>
    <li>Large and active community</li>
    <li>Great documentation and resources</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Setting up Python</h2>
  <p>Getting started with Python is straightforward. Follow these steps:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Visit the official Python website at <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">python.org</a></li>
    <li>Download the latest version for your operating system</li>
    <li>Run the installer and follow the installation wizard</li>
    <li>Verify the installation by opening a terminal and typing:</li>
  </ol>

  <pre><code>python --version</code></pre>

  <h2>Your First Python Program</h2>
  <p>Let's write the traditional "Hello, World!" program:</p>

  <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>

  <p>Save this code in a file named <code>hello.py</code> and run it using:</p>

  <pre><code>python hello.py</code></pre>

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>Now that you have Python installed and have run your first program, you're ready to dive deeper into Python programming. In the next tutorial, we'll explore Python basics including variables, data types, and basic operations.</p>
